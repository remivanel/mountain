Price of the software:
----------------------

Full version: 450 FFrancs (69 EUR)


How to register:
----------------
You must proceed by steps:

* Start the program REG_MNT.PRG on your machine.
* Keep the file REG_MNT.DTA thus created.
* Copy this file on a floppy and send it to me together 
  with your full details (including your email if possible),
  your setup and the cheque, adressed to R‚mi Vanel
  (see adress at the end of this text).
- you can send the file by email if you want to spare 
  a floppy disk:
  vanel@club-internet.fr
* Wait a few days, and you will receive the printed
  manual of Mountain, with a special file mount_r.dta, which 
  you will have to install in the module folder of the last 
  demo version of Mountain, downloaded from my web site.
- I can send you this file by email, I will spare a 
  floppy disk and you will be able to use the full version 
  of Mountain faster.
* You can routinely download the last demo version of Mountain 
  to update your software.
  
+ KEEP PRECIOUSLY YOUR FILE MOUNT_R.DTA
+ NEVER GIVE IT TO ANYONE!!

Contact me in case of problem.
I cannot be held responsible for any damage caused by my 
software.

If you find that the price is too expensive for you, contact me, 
perhaps it will be possible to agree on an exchange or a 
reduction. I wouldn't want that someone willing to use 
Mountain should be detered from it for a question of money.
It is also possible to pay in some steps if you want to.
